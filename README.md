# red_wine_quality_prediction

Objective: This data science project aims to predict the quality of red variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset includes physicochemical (input) and sensory (output) variables, while lacking information about grape types, wine brands, or selling prices due to privacy and logistical constraints.

Problem Type: The dataset can be treated as both a classification and a regression task. The quality scores are ordered and not evenly distributed, with a greater number of normal wines compared to excellent or poor ones.

This project draws inspiration from Sukhman Singh's previous work while predicting the quality of red wine, leveraging the dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle.
